# Overview

## General architecture

Stellio is composed of 2 business services:

-   One service (called `search-service` in the source) is in charge of handling the requests 
    for the Core and Temporal APIs. It is backed by a PostgreSQL database, extended with 
    the [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/) and [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) extensions 
-   One service (called `subscription-service` in the source) is in charge of handling the requests 
    for the Subscription API. It is backed by a PostgreSQL database, extended with the
    [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) extension

It is completed with:

-   An API Gateway component, based on [Spring Cloud Gateway](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-gateway/reference/html/), 
    that simply forwards the incoming requests to one of the downstream services, based on the request path
-   A [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) streaming engine that decouples communication inside the broker 
    (and allows plugging other services seamlessly). It is described in more details in the
    [internal event model](user/internal_event_model.md) page.

The services are based on the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework, developed in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), and built with [Gradle](https://gradle.org).

# Quick start

A quick way to start using Stellio is to use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory 
(feel free to change the default passwords defined in the `.env` file):

```shell
docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
```

It will start all the services composing the Stellio context broker platform and expose them on the following ports:

-   API Gateway: 8080
-   Search service: 8083
-   Subscription service: 8084

Please note that the environment and scripts are validated on recent Debian/Ubuntu versions and MacOS. Some errors may occur on other platforms.

Docker images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/stellio/repositories).

# Development

## Developing on a service

Requirements:

-   Java 17 (we recommend using [sdkman!](https://sdkman.io/) to install
    and manage versions of the JDK)

To develop on a specific service, you can use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file inside each service's directory, for
instance:

```shell
cd search-service docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
```

Then, from the root directory, launch the service:

```shell
./gradlew search-service:bootRun
```

## Running the tests

Each service has a suite of unit and integration tests. You can run them without manually launching any external component, 
thanks to Spring Boot embedded test support and to the great [TestContainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) library.

For instance, you can launch the test suite for entity service with the following command:

```shell
./gradlew search-service:test
```

## Building the project

To build all the services, you can just launch:

```shell
./gradlew build
```

It will compile the source code, check the code formatting (thanks to [ktLint](https://ktlint.github.io/)) and run the 
test suite for all the services.

For each service, a self executable jar is produced in the `build/libs` directory of the service.

If you want to build only one of the services, you can launch:

```shell
./gradlew search-service:build
```

## Working locally with Docker images

To work locally with a Docker image of a service without publishing it
to Docker Hub, you can follow the below instructions:

-   Build a tar image:

```shell
./gradlew search-service:jibBuildTar
```

-   Load the tar image into Docker:

```shell
docker load --input search-service/build/jib-image.tar
```

-   Run the image:

```shell
docker run stellio/stellio-search-service:latest-dev
```

# Usage

To start using Stellio, you can follow the [API quick guide](API_walkthrough.md).

As the development environment does not make use of the authentication setup, you can ignore related information in the API quick guide.
